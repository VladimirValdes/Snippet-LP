## ðŸ’  What I Learn

 âœ… I learned how to avoid Layout Flickering On Browser Resize that is common in hamburger menu animations
   I read this article [Layout Flickering On Browser Resize](https://ishadeed.com/article/layout-flickering/) by [Ahmad](https://ishadeed.com/) to fix it.

 âœ… Another thing that I learned was about interpolation in SASS I read a part of SASS documentation you can check [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation);
